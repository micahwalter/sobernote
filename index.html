[Rainy] Season's greetings! Hope you're staying cool and dry! Come June 26th, you'll have a worthwhile reason to get hot 'n sweaty! Sober and the Notes will be doing a live show at Duke Capo in Shimokitazawa, with bass, drums and a new guitarist! I'm anxious to see how it goes! Come out if you can!

An update is long overdue, as the last one was...2 years ago! (Giving new meaning to 'leap year'...) Yes, 2015 came and went, but not without progress. Played a few shows around Tokyo and had some help from guest performers. In addition, I've been putting together a group of good musicians to assist in the dispensing of notes - hence the name "Sober and the Notes."  We'll be hitting the rehearsal studio regularly and hope to do a number of dates over the next few months, starting late spring, most likely! Drop by again for show info and other pertinent news!

"Indian Burn" is now available at cdbaby, iTunes, AmazonMP3, and just anywhere and everywhere else you could imagine--in the cyber world, that is (as the physical CDs are not yet availble)... You can click the MUSIC tab on this page to find links to cdbaby.

The road was long, but the new album has finally been completed and should be available within the next few days (cdbaby.com, itunes, etc). Among other things, it has been a tremendous learning experience!
